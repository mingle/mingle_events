    # Filters events by card types. As events do not contain the type
    # of the card, this filter requires a lookup against Mingle to
    # determine the type of the card that sourced the event. In the case
    # of the card's being deleted in the interim between the actual event
    # and this filtering, the event will be filtered as there is no means
    # to determine its type. Therefore, it's recommended to also
    # subscribe a 'CardDeleted' processor to the same project.
